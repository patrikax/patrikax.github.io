10 posters and a folder.

"A Picture is worth a Thousand Words", literary interpreted, seems to consist of two factors; math and poetry, which are also two recurrent elements in my process.

Ten expressions of math and poetry. The original prints are letterpress, woodcut and stamp prints. Postproduction in Indesign.
